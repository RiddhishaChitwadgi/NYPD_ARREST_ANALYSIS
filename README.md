# NYPD Arrest Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains code and data related to the analysis of NYPD arrest data. The project aims to explore and analyze patterns in arrest data using various data science and machine learning techniques.

## Files and Folders

- **01-Data-Cleaning.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning.
- **02-EDA.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis.
- **03-logistic-regression.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for logistic regression analysis.
- **04-randomforest.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for random forest analysis.

### Data Files

- **NYPD_Arrest_Data__Year_to_Date_.csv**: Raw arrest data.
- **NYPD_Arrest_Data__Year_to_Date_cleaned.csv**: Cleaned arrest data.

### Shape Files

- **geo_export_a8dbf47e-367d-47ea-a7b7-13c34bbbf683.shp**: Shapefile.
- **geo_export_a8dbf47e-367d-47ea-a7b7-13c34bbbf683.shx**: SHX file.

## Getting Started

To replicate the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RiddhishaChitwadgi/NYPD_ARREST_ANALYSIS.git
cd NYPD_ARREST_ANALYSIS
```
# Running the Jupyter Notebooks

To replicate the analysis, follow these steps and run the Jupyter Notebooks in the specified order:

1. **Data Cleaning Notebook - 01-Data-Cleaning.ipynb:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook: `01-Data-Cleaning.ipynb`.
   - Execute each cell in sequential order to perform data cleaning operations.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis Notebook - 02-EDA.ipynb:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook: `02-EDA.ipynb`.
   - Execute each cell to explore and visualize the cleaned data.

3. **Logistic Regression Analysis Notebook - 03-logistic-regression.ipynb:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook: `03-logistic-regression.ipynb`.
   - Execute each cell to perform logistic regression analysis on the preprocessed data.

4. **Random Forest Analysis Notebook - 04-randomforest.ipynb:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook: `04-randomforest.ipynb`.
   - Execute each cell to implement and analyze the random forest model.

Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed and that the data files (`NYPD_Arrest_Data__Year_to_Date_cleaned.csv` and others if required) are available in the appropriate locations as specified in the notebooks.

After exploring the analysis, don't forget to check out the interactive dashboard on Tableau Public. [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/riddhisha.chitwadgi/viz/NewyorkArrestpatterns/Dashboard2](#).
